## 🚀 Getting Started

Fancy a go? Here’s how you can run the app locally (no wellies required):

# or
yarn dev

pnpm dev

bun dev
```

Then pop over to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. If it doesn’t work, try turning it off and on again. 😉

## 🥕 Features

- **Inventory Management:** Keep track of your food stash like a pro. No more finding that mouldy cheese at the back of the fridge!
- **Wishlist:** Add items you fancy buying. Because who doesn’t love a good list?
- **Recipes:** (Coming soon!) Save your favourite recipes. Mary Berry would be proud.
- **Summary Dashboard:** See what’s expiring soon, what’s out of stock, and more. It’s like having your own personal butler, but less chatty.
